## Installation

For using the mod, you need to have <b>[JaLoader](https://github.com/theLeaxx/JaLoader)</b> installed.

Then, you just have to [download](https://github.com/MeblIkea/CameraPlacements/releases) the mod from the Releases, and you can copy `CameraPlacements.dll` in `C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Jalopy\Mods`, and the `Jalopy_Data` folder in the root folder of your game, so it will automaticly put the assets files in `Jalopy_Data`.<br><br>

## How does it works?

After loading the game, you can go to the main menu (or in-game, it's the same).
Press F10, and you should see a menu at the bottom-left corner. ⚠️<b>If you don't see it, there is an issue.</b>⚠️

Press `Switch view to freecam` to get in FreeCam. If you don't like the camera rolling, you can lock X&Z axis, it might be better.
You can manually change it's position / rotation, and *Control + Scroll* change the camera FOV, while just scrolling change the camera speed (Press *shift* while scrolling for increasing faster).

Press `Add Point` for adding a keyframe. It will create a new point at the FreeCam position (and will copy its rotation, Field Of View (FOV) and speed).
You can select a point with the slider, and change it's properties.
*(You can also edit it with Shift + Space (preview), and moving the camera will apply its modification to the poit)*

Wait time is how many milliseconds it takes, before starting (from this point).
Animation mode is the mod of animation. Triangle is linear, the Round is round (EaseInOut), and the Square is direct.

For playing the animation, click **Launch animation**.

You can give a name for your `Group` *(= save)*, and click `Manage Saves` for opening a new window, so you can manage the other saves (Load and Delete them).
